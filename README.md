UNIX port of Hovertank 3-D
=============

This repository containing current work on UNIX port of the famous game written for 16bit DOS back in April 1991. This work started for understanding pioner 3d tech rather than quick jump on UNIX, so don't expect 4K FPS from me in next month :) thats a long journey... anyway you can always build 91s source (640x260 gaming), i've disabled camera shake to avoid sickness there. To build those you need to open project with Borland C++ 3.1, which runs fine in Windows XP or earlier (btw build will run too fast on XP) or better use dosbox. if you have any questions feel free to contact me at telegram (link located under profilepic).
